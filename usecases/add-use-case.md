# Add use case

If you have had to work with non-trivial problems working with Npgsql.FSharp and you think it might be useful or interesting to share, please send a pull request with a document to the repository in the `/docs/app/usecases` directory and I will review it. Thanks a lot!

You can also run the documentation website locally as follows from the `master` branch:
```bash
cd docs
npm install
npm start
```
